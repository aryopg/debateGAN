S'The court ruled that the Ohio program met the five-part test in that 1) the valid secular purpose of the program was "providing educational assistance to poor children in a demonstrably failing public school system"  2) the vouchers were given to the parents  3) the "broad class" was all students enrolled in currently failing programs  4) parents who received vouchers were not required to enroll in a religious-based school  and 5) there were other public schools in adjoining districts  as well as non-sectarian private schools in the Cleveland area  available that would accept vouchers .'
