S'If the Soviet Union also had nuclear weapons and a policy of "massive retaliation" was carried out  it was reasoned  then any Soviet forces not killed in the initial attack  or launched while the attack was ongoing  would be able to serve their own form of nuclear "retaliation" against the U .S . Recognizing that this was an undesirable outcome  military officers and game theorists at the RAND think tank developed a nuclear warfare strategy that was eventually called Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) .'
