S"One high-profile example of tactical voting was the California gubernatorial election  2002 . During the Republican primaries  Republicans' Richard Riordan (former mayor of Los Angeles) and Bill Simon (a self-financed businessman) were vying for a chance to compete against the unpopular incumbent Democratic Governor of California  Gray Davis . Polls predicted that Riordan would defeat Davis  while Simon would not .   At that time  the Republican primaries were open primaries in which anyone could vote regardless of her or his own party affiliation  Davis supporters were rumored to have voted for Simon because Riordan was perceived as a greater threat to Davis"
