S"For most of his reign  Henry IV was forced to fight off plots and rebellions; his success was partly due to the military skill of his son  the future Henry V . Henry V's own reign  which began in 1413  was largely free from domestic strife  leaving the king free to pursue the Hundred Years' War in France ."
