S'A 25 May 2010 United Nations Development Programme report stated that  as a result of the blockade  most of Gaza\'s manufacturing industry has closed  and unemployment stood at an estimated 40%  a decrease on previous years . The blockade has also prevented much needed construction  noting that almost "none of the 3 425 homes destroyed during Cast Lead have been reconstructed  displacing around 20 000 people" . Less than 20% "of the value of the damages to educational facilities has been repaired"  only "half of the damage to the power network has been repaired"  "no repair has been made to the transport infrastructure"  "a quarter of damaged farmland has been rehabilitated and only 40% of private businesses have been repaired" '
