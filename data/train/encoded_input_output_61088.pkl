S'Michigan lost to Ohio State 42&ndash;39 in its regular season finale (Ohio State would go on to claim the Big 10 championship)  but was still ranked ahead of Florida but behind USC going into the final ballot . Florida defeated Arkansas in the SEC Championship Game  and number 2 ranked USC lost to UCLA  leaving Michigan and Florida as one-loss teams who both claimed they deserved to play for the national championship against Ohio State . Many pundits denied that Michigan should get another chance to play Ohio State . Others claimed that this would only be a repeat of what happened in 1996 between Florida and Florida State  and that the two best teams should play even if they were from the same conference or if it was a rematch . Ultimately  the BCS National Championship was a meeting between Ohio State and Florida . A mere  .0101 points separated #2 Florida from #3 Michigan'
