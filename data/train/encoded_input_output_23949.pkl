S'the Bolsheviks (in Soviet Russia)  who  inspired by "an ideological creed which professed that all religion would atrophy"  "resolved to eradicate Christianity as such" . In 1918 "[t]en Orthodox hierarchs were summarily shot" and "[c]hildren were deprived of any religious education outside the home ." Increasingly draconian measures were employed . In addition to direct state persecution  the League of the Militant Godless was founded in 1925  churches were closed and vandalized and "by 1938 eighty bishops had lost their lives  while thousands of clerics were sent to labour camps ."'
