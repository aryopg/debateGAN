S'What is wrong with our sick  neurotic world is that we have been moulded  and an adult generation that has seen two great wars and seems about to launch a third should not be trusted to mould the character of a rat" -- A .S . Neill "What cannot be doubted is that a piece of fascinating and valuable educational research is going on here which it would do all educationists good to see" -- Report by Her Majesty\'s Inspectors of Schools  1949 "I would as soon enroll a child of mine in a brothel as in Summerhill" -- Max Rafferty "When my first wife and I began the school  we had one main idea: to make the school fit the child - instead of making the child fit the school" -- A .S . Neill  .'
