S'Also in 2009  a spokeswoman for the Sderot Hosen Center  which provides psychological support and rehabilitation for the community  reported that attacks had taken a high toll on the mental health of children and adults in and around Sderot . Children are afraid to sleep on their own  to be on their own  even to go to the toilet alone . They feel that their parents cannot protect them . Bed wetting is a common manifestation of their anxiety and insecurity . Their parents are similarly anxious and frustrated . It is even difficult to speak of PTSD  for as long as the rockets fall the trauma is renewed daily; we are not even in a post-trauma stage '
