S'In the oldest written account  by an Egyptian named Uha  in the 23rd century BC  he describes a mass circumcision and boasts of his ability to stoically endure the pain: "When I was circumcised  together with one hundred and twenty men . .there was none thereof who hit out  there was none thereof who was hit  and there was none thereof who scratched and there was none thereof who was scratched .'
