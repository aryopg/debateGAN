S"An instance of a Governor General exercising his power was during the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis  when the Australian Prime Minister of the time  Gough Whitlam  was dismissed by the Governor-General . The Australian senate had threatened to block the Government's budget by refusing to pass the associated appropriation bills . On 11 November 1975  Whitlam intended to call a half-Senate election in an attempt to break the deadlock . When he went to seek the Governor-General's approval of the election  the Governor-General instead dismissed him as Prime Minister  and shortly thereafter installed leader of the opposition Malcolm Fraser in his place"
