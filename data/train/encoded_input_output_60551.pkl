S'In 2008  the situation was repeated when one-loss Oklahoma was selected for the BCS Championship over one-loss Texas  which beat the Sooners during the regular season .This stemmed from an earlier controversy regarding the championship of the Big 12 South Division . Because Oklahoma  Texas  and Texas Tech had all finished the season 11-1  with Texas beating Oklahoma  Oklahoma beating Texas Tech  and Texas Tech beating Texas  the division champion was decided by which team was ranked the highest in the final BCS standings prior to the Championship Game . Texas had a commanding advantage over Oklahoma in the Harris Interactive  and the two teams were separated by just one point in the USA Today poll  but the computers gave Oklahoma the right to play in the Big 12 Championship Game'
