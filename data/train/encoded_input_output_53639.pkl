S'The harsh austerity measures have helped Greece bring down its primary deficit before interest payments  from 24 .7bn (10 .6% of GDP) in 2009 to just 5 .2bn (2 .4% of GDP) in 2011  but as a side-effect they also contributed to a worsening of the Greek recession  which began in October 2008 and only became worse in 2010 and 2011  . Overall the Greek GDP had its worst decline in 2011 with -6 .9%  a year where the seasonal adjusted industrial output ended 28 .4% lower than in 2005  and with 111 000 Greek companies going bankrupt (27% higher than in 2010)  . As a result  the seasonal adjusted unemployment rate also grew from 7 .5% in September 2008 to a record high of 19 .9% in November 2011  while the Youth unemployment rate during the same time rose from 22 .0% to as high as 48 .1% '
