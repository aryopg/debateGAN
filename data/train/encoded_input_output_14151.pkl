S'The American Cancer Society stated:  .   Circumcision seems to protect against penile cancer when it is done shortly after birth . Men who were circumcised as babies have less than half the chance of getting penile cancer than those who were not . The reasons for this are not entirely clear  but may be related to other known risk factors . For example  men who are circumcised cannot develop a condition called phimosis . Men with phimosis have an increased risk of penile cancer (see below) . Also  circumcised men seem to be less likely to be infected with HPV  even after adjusting for differences in sexual behavior'
