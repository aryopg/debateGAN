S"In 1977  one of East Germany's best sprinters  Renate Neufeld  fled to the West with the Bulgarian she later married . A year later she said that she had been told to take drugs supplied by coaches while training to represent East Germany in the 1980 Olympic Games .   At 17  I joined the East Berlin Sports Institute . My speciality was the 80m hurdles . We swore that we would never speak to anyone about our training methods  including our parents . The training was very hard . We were all watched . We signed a register each time we left for dormitory and we had to say where we were going and what time we would return . One day  my trainer  Gunter Clam  advised me to take pills to improve my performance: I was running 200m in 24 seconds . My trainer told me the pills were vitamins  but I soon had cramp in my legs  my voice became gruff and sometimes I couldn't talk any more . Then I started to grow a moustache and my periods stopped . I then refused to take these pills . One morning in October 1977  the secret police took me at 7am and questioned me about my refusal to take pills prescribed by the trainer . I then decided to flee  with my fiance  .   She brought with her to the West grey tablets and green powder she said had been given to her  to members of her club  and to other athletes . The West German doping analyst Manfred Donike reportedly identified them as anabolic steroids"
