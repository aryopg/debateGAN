S'In the 1994 study of Robert K . Goidel and Todd G . Shields in The Journal of Politics  180 students at the University of Kentucky were randomly assigned to nine groups and were asked questions about the same set of election scenarios .

Independents  which are those who do not vote based on the endorsement of any party and are ultimately neutral  were influenced strongly in favor of the person expected to win (Goidel and Shields 807-808) . Expectations played a significant role throughout the study . It was found that independents are twice as likely to vote for the Republican candidate when the Republican is expected to win .
