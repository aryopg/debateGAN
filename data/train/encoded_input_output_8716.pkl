S'In the case of Cowan v . Milbourn (1867) the defendant had broken his contract to let a lecture-room to the plaintiff  on discovering that the intended lectures were to maintain that the character of Christ is defective  and his teaching misleading  and that the Bible is no more inspired than any other book  and the court of exchequer held that the publication of such doctrine was blasphemy  and the contract therefore illegal .'
