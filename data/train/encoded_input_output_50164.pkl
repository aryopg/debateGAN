S'Indonesia\'s Permanent Representative to the United Nations  Marty Natalegawa  viewed the protests and crackdown in Myanmar (which is a member of ASEAN) with concern and called for restraint in part of the Burmese government:  .   "We are seriously following these developments very closely . We are concerned by it . We are calling on the authorities to exercise maximum restraint and desist from any acts that could cause further violence . Indonesia\'s approach has always been one of engagement  not necessarily meaning that we are less concerned about the situation therein . We are just convinced that the best way to go is through engagement and encouragement'
