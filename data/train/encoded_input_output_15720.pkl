S'the absolute majority of the gun crimes in Brazil were committed with unregistered and illegal guns  specially high caliber guns  that were already forbidden in Brazil and due to that  it would be of no use to forbid law-abiding citizens to own legal registered guns in accordance to the law . This argument was strongly reinforced by the fact that the regions where gun ownership is widespread were the ones with the smallest number of gun-related deaths . In the South region where there is the highest number of legal guns per citizen only 59% of all murders were caused by firearms in contrast to 70% in the Northeast where there is the lowest number of legal firearms per citizen '
