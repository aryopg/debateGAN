S'One of the earliest known uses of the Internet as a medium for activism was that around Lotus MarketPlace . On April 10  1990  Lotus announced a direct-mail marketing database product that was to contain name  address  and spending habit information on 120 million individual U .S . citizens . While much of the same data was already available  privacy advocates worried about the availability of this data within one database . Furthermore  the data would be on CD-ROM  and so would remain fixed until a new CD-ROM was issued .   In response  a mass e-mail and E-bulletin-board campaign was started  which included information on contacting Lotus and form letters . Larry Seiler  a New England-based computer professional posted a message that was widely reposted on newsgroups and via e-mail: "It will contain a LOT of personal information about YOU  which anyone in the country can access by just buying the discs . It seems to me (and to a lot of other people  too) that this will be a little too much like big brother  and it seems like a good idea to get out while there is still time ."Over 30 000 people contacted Lotus and asked for their names to be removed from the database . On January 23  1991  Lotus announced that it had cancelled MarketPlace '
