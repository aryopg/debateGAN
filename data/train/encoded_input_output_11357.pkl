S'In his book First Principles (1862)  the 19th-century English philosopher Herbert Spencer has a chapter on "Ultimate Religious Ideas" in which he writes that  as regards the origin of the universe  three hypotheses are possible: self-existence (atheism)  self-creation (pantheism) or creation by an external agency (theism)  . Analyzing these three hypotheses  however  Spencer finds that  "differing so widely as they seem to do"  they all "contain the same ultimate element . It is impossible to avoid making the assumption of self-existence somewhere"  whether with regard to a part of the universe (atheism)  the universe as a whole (pantheism)  or an external creator (theism) . Furthermore  the idea of self-existence is not merely inescapable but "rigorously inconceivable; and this holds true whatever be the nature of the object of which it is predicated" . For Spencer  therefore  atheism  pantheism and theism alike  despite "seeming to their adherents quite rational  turn out  when critically examined  to be literally unthinkable"  . In view of its inability to evade assuming self-existence somewhere  "even that which is commonly regarded as the negation of all religion  even positive Atheism comes within the definition" of religion '
