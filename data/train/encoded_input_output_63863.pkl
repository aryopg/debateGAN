S'The report stated that the strike on the al-Maqadmah mosque on the outskirts of Jabilyah occurred when between 200 and 300 men and women attended for their evening prayer  with 15 people being killed and 40 wounded as a result of the attack . The Mission has established that the Israeli armed forces fired a missile that struck near the doorway of the mosque . The Mission found that the mosque was damaged and lodged in its interior walls with "small metal cubes"  several of which were retrieved by the Mission when it inspected the site . The Mission concluded that the mosque had been hit by an air-to-ground missile fitted with a shrapnel fragmentation sleeve  fired from an aircraft . The Mission based its findings on investigation of the site  photographs and interviewing witnesses . The Mission found no indications that the mosque was used to launch rockets  store munitions or shelter combatants . The Mission also found that no other damage was done in the area at the time  making the attack an isolated incident . The Mission concluded that the Israelis intentionally bombed the mosque  . Judge Goldstone said: "Assuming that weapons were stored in the mosque  it would not be a war crime to bomb it at night . . It would be a war crime to bomb it during the day when 350 people are praying" . He further added that there is no other possible interpretation for what could have occurred other than a deliberate targeting of civilians '
