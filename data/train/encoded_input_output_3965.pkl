S"In September 2007 in Ohio  16-year-old Daniel Petric snuck out of his bedroom window to purchase the game Halo 3 against the orders of his father  a minister at New Life Assembly of God in Wellington  Ohio  U .S  . His parents eventually banned him from the game after he spent up to 18 hours a day with it  and secured it in a lockbox in a closet where the father also kept a 9mm handgun  according to prosecutors  . In October 2007  Daniel used his father's key to open the lockbox and remove the gun and the game . He then entered the living room of his house and shot both of them in the head  killing his mother and wounding his father"
