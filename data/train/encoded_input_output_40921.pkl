S"Protestants almost universally criticize the idea that the Holy Communion as celebrated in Catholic churches has the nature of a sacrifice; that is  Christ becomes wholly and really present under the forms of bread and wine  and He is offered to God by the Catholic priest for the remission of sins  by means of eating the Host (Christ's body) and drinking the Wine (Christ's blood) ."
