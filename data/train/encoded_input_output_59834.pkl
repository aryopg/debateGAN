S'In Greenbelt Cooperative Publishing Association  Inc . v . Bresler    the Supreme Court ruled that a Greenbelt News Review article  which quoted a visitor to a city council meeting who characterized Bresler\'s aggressive stance in negotiating with the city as "blackmail"  was not libelous since nobody could believe anyone was claiming that Bresler had committed the crime of blackmail and that the statement was essentially hyperbole (i .e .  clearly an opinion) .'
