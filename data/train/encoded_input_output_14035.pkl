S'Ricci v . DeStefano was heard by the United States Supreme Court in 2009 . The case concerns white and Hispanic firefighters in New Haven  Connecticut  who upon passing their test for promotions to management were denied the promotions  allegedly because of a discriminatory or at least questionable test . The test gave 17 whites and two Hispanics the possibility of immediate promotion . Although 23% of those taking the test were African American  none scored high enough to qualify . Because of the possibility the tests were biased in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act  no candidates were promoted pending outcome of the controversy  . In a split 5-4 vote  the Supreme Court ruled that New Haven had engaged in impermissible racial discrimination against the White and Hispanic majority'
