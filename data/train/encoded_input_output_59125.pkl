S'In December 1965  a group of five students  including lead plaintiff John Tinker and his sister Mary Beth Tinker  wore black armbands overlaid with a white peace sign between the dates of December 16 and New Years Day . The principals of the students\' schools had previously threatened to suspend any students who participated in the protest . Despite the warning  the small group of students proceeded to carry out their dissent  and were duly suspended . ACLU attorneys representing the students argued that the armbands constituted a form of symbolic speech and  because their demonstration was suppressed  their First Amendment rights were unconstitutionally restrained . The court voted 72 in favor of Tinker  finding that the suspension had violated .  Justice Fortas  delivering the opinion of the court  held the following:  "In wearing armbands  the petitioners were quiet and passive . They were not disruptive  and did not impinge upon the rights of others . In these circumstances  their conduct was within the protection of the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth'
