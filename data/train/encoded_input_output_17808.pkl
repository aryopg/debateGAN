S'In September 2007 in Ohio  16-year-old Daniel Petric snuck out of his bedroom window to purchase the game Halo 3 against the orders of his father  a minister at New Life Assembly of God in Wellington  Ohio  U .S  . His parents eventually banned him from the game after he spent up to 18 hours a day with it  and secured it in a lockbox in a closet where the father also kept a 9mm handgun  according to prosecutors  . In October 2007  Daniel used his father\'s key to open the lockbox and remove the gun and the game . He then entered the living room of his house and shot both of them in the head  killing his mother and wounding his father . Petric is sentenced to life in prison without parole  which was later commuted to 23 years in imprisonment  . Defense attorneys argued that Petric was influenced by video game addiction  the court dismissed these claims . The judge  James Burge commented that while he thought there was ample evidence the boy knew what he was doing  Burge thought the game had affected him like a drug  saying "I firmly believe that Daniel Petric had no idea at the time he hatched this plot that if he killed his parents they would be dead forever ."'
