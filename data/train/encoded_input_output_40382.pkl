S"Gairdner's 1949 study reported that an average of 16 children per year out of about 90 000 died following circumcision in the UK . He found that most deaths had occurred suddenly under anaesthesia and could not be explained further  but hemorrhage and infection had also proven fatal . Deaths attributed to phimosis and circumcision were grouped together  and Gairdner argued that such deaths were probably due to the circumcision operation "
