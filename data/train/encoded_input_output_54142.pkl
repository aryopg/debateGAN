S'Affirmative action was first established in Executive Order 10925  which was signed by President John F . Kennedy on March 6  1961 and required government contractors to "not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of race  creed  color  or national origin" as well as to "take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed  and that employees are treated during employment  without regard to their race  creed  color  or national origin"  .'
