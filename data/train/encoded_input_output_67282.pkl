S'Research shows that schools with students that perform lower than the norm are also those hiring least-qualified teachers as a result of new teachers generally working in the area that they grew up in . This leads to certain schools not producing many students that go on to college . Students from these schools that go on to be college graduates are not as skilled as they would be if they had gone to a school with higher-qualified instructors . This leads to education perpetuating a cycle of poverty'
