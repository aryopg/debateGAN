S"A famous case of illicit AAS use in a competition was Canadian Ben Johnson's victory in the 100&nbsp;m at the 1988 Summer Olympics . He subsequently failed the drug test when stanozolol was found in his urine . He later admitted to using the steroid as well as Dianabol  Testosterone Cypionate  Furazabol  and human growth hormone amongst other things . Johnson was therefore stripped of his gold medal as well as recognition of what had been a world-record performance"
