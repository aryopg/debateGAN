S'HRW rejected Hamas\'s claim: Hamas\' claim that rockets were intended to hit Israeli military targets and only accidentally harmed civilians is belied by the facts . Civilians were the target  deliberately targeting civilians is a war crime . HRW deputy Middle East director Joe Stork stated: "Hamas can spin the story and deny the evidence  but hundreds of rockets rained down on civilian areas in Israel where no military installations were located ."'
