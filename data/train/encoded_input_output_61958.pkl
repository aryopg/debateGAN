S'Chavez was the epitome of the "Mexican" style of boxing . He relentlessly stalked and closed in on the other fighter  ignoring whatever punishment he took for the chance to dish out his own at close range  particularly in the form of a crunching body attack that would either wear down his opponents until they collapsed in pain and exhaustion  or became too tired to defend as Chavez shifted his attack to the head and went for a knockout'
