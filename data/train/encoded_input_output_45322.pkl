S"During the Vietnam War  some children of wealthy families wished to avoid a perception of avoiding military service . Those individuals often signed up for the National Guard  which at the time seldom sent troops overseas . The fact that some were able to use their family's connections to gain a position when spots in the Guard were limited also led to a perception that the wealthy were using the National Guard to ensure that their children were assigned low-risk duty in the U .S ."
