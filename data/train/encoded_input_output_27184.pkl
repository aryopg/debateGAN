S'If the child misbehaves by destroying his playthings . . .the misbehavior is not that he has thoughtlessly and rather stupidly denied himself a way of entertaining himself; rather  it consists in his being insensitive to the general rule that prohibits useless destruction . . . Only disapproval can warn him that not only was the conduct nonsensical but that it was bad conduct violating a rule that should be obeyed .'
