S"The determination of equality of opportunity in such an instance is based on mathematical probability: if equality of opportunity is in effect  then it's seen as fair if each of two applicants has a 50% chance of winning the job  that is  they both have equal chances to succeed (assuming of course that the person making the probability assessment is unaware of all variables  including valid ones such as talent or skill as well as arbitrary ones such as race or gender .)"
