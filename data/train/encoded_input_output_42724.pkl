S'According to an IMF official austerity measures have helped Greece bring down its primary deficit before interest payments  from 24 .7bn (10 .6% of GDP) in 2009 to just 5 .2bn (2 .4% of GDP) in 2011  but as a side-effect they also contributed to a worsening of the Greek recession  which began in October 2008 and only became worse in 2010 and 2011  . Overall the Greek GDP had its worst decline in 2011 with -6 .9%  a year where the seasonal adjusted industrial output ended 28 .4% lower than in 2005  and with 111 000 Greek companies going bankrupt (27% higher than in 2010)  . As a result  the seasonal adjusted unemployment rate also grew from 7 .5% in September 2008 to a record high of 19 .9% in November 2011  while the Youth unemployment rate during the same time rose from 22 .0% to as high as 48 .1%  .The social effects of the austerity measures on the Greek population have been severe  as well as on poor and needy foreign immigrants  with some Greek citizens turning to NGOs for healthcare treatment and having to give up children for adoption  . By March 2012  the suicide rate had increased by 40% '
