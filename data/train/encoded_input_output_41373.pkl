S"Jefferson's letter was in reply to a letter that he had received from the Danbury Baptist Association dated October 7  1801 . In an 1808 letter to Virginia Baptists  Jefferson would use the same theme:  .   We have solved  by fair experiment  the great and interesting question whether freedom of religion is compatible with order in government and obedience to the laws . And we have experienced the quiet as well as the comfort which results from leaving every one to profess freely and openly those principles of religion which are the inductions of his own reason and the serious convictions of his own inquiries"
