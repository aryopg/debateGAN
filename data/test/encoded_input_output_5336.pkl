S'"To this end" he wrote  meaning the end of their own long life and peace  "it is that men give up all their natural power to the society they enter into  and the community put the legislative power into such hands as they think fit  with this trust  that they shall be governed by declared laws  or else their peace  quiet  and property will still be at the same uncertainty as it was in the state of nature ."'
