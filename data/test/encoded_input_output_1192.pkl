S"Possible reasons for natural evils include that they are caused by the free choices of supernatural beings such as demons (these beings are not so powerful as to limit God's omnipotenceanother possible response  discussed later); that they are caused by original sin which in turn is caused by free will; that they are caused by natural laws that must operate as they do if intelligent  free agents are to exist; or that through observation and copying they allow humans to perform greater evils  which makes moral decisions more significant  ."
