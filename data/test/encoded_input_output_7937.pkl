S'In June 1973 The House of Lords ruled that Commonwealth and Pakistani illegal entrants who had arrived in the UK between 1962 and 1968 were all legally irremovable; that those same nationalities entering illegally between 1968 and 1973 were also irremovable if they had been in the country longer than 6 months and that only those who had arrived after 1/1/73 were subject to illegal entry action .'
