S'Johnson was charged with violating the Texas law that prohibits vandalizing respected objects (desecration of a venerated object) . He was convicted  sentenced to one year in prison  and fined $2 000 . He appealed his conviction to the Fifth Court of Appeals of Texas  but he lost this appeal . The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals would then see his case . This was the highest court in Texas that would see Criminal Appeals . That court overturned his conviction  saying that the State could not punish Johnson for burning the flag because the First Amendment protects such activity as symbolic speech'
