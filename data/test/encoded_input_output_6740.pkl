S'This sense was also expressed by economists Milton and Rose Friedman in their 1980 book Free to Choose  . The Friedmans explained that equality of opportunity was "not to be interpreted literally" since some children are born blind while others are born sighted  but that "its real meaning is  . . a career open to the talents ." This means that there should be "no arbitrary obstacles" blocking a person from realizing their ambitions  and that "Not birth  nationality  color  religion  sex  nor any other irrelevant characteristic should determine the opportunities that are open to a person  only his abilities ."'
